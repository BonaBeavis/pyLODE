The labour market is sometimes used as a de-facto measure of the functional extent of a city as it contains the majority of the commuting population. It is important to note that GCCSAs do not define the built up edge of the city this is better represented by Urban Centres and Localities (UCLs) or Significant Urban Areas (SUAs). The GCCSA is designed to provide a stable definition of the capital cities to enable production of economic indicators which integrate variables collected over long periods of time.

Presently there remain areas of rural South Australia and rural Australian Capital Territory for which Gazetted Localities remain undefined. Various islands offshore from New South Wales Victoria and Tasmania and some inshore water areas and islands are also undefined. Since 1996 Locality boundaries have been formalised for most areas of Australia through a program coordinated by the Permanent Committee on Place Names (PCPN) under the umbrella of the Intergovernmental Committee On Surveying and Mapping (ISCM). Areas where localities are not gazetted are represented by Remainder SSCs.SSCs are approximated using one or more Mesh Blocks (MBs).

SA1s aim to separate out areas with different geographic characteristics within Suburb and Locality boundaries. In rural areas they often combine related Locality boundaries. SA1s are aggregations of Mesh Blocks (MBs). Whole SA1s aggregate to form Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s) Indigenous Locations (ILOCs) Urban Centres and Localities (UCLs) Remoteness Areas (RAs) Commonwealth Electoral Divisions (CEDs) and State Electoral Divisions (SEDs).

Most MBs contain 30 to 60 dwellings although some are specifically designed to have zero. This provides an additional level of confidentiality for data released on the ASGS as the difference in data released on multiple statistical areas is always at least one MB. Mesh Blocks like other ABS structures in the ASGS are stable for 5 years and are updated to reflect changes such as new housing developments every 5 years.
